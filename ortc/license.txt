   The GNU AGPL is a modified version of the ordinary GNU GPL version 3. It has one added requirement: if you run the program on a server and let other users communicate with it there, your server must also allow them to download the source code corresponding to the program that it's running.

   ORTCLib is available without the GNU AGPL terms and conditions and restrictions for those who obtain a commercial license of the ORTCLib software from the developers and copyright holder of ORTCLib SMB Phone Inc. or Hookflash Inc.

This allows the ORTCLib to be distributed in the same manners allowed by the Open Peer SDK so long as the ORTCLib is exclusively utilized with the Open Peer SDK to develop Open Peer compatible clients and services. The ORTCLib may not be extracted for use as a non dependency of the Open Peer SDK and maintain the FreeBSD license compatibility.
 
   If you include or distribute ORTCLib within an application or hosted service that is not also licensed under GNU AGPL or GPL-compatible license or within the context of the Open Peer SDK as described above, you must obtain a commercial license.
